One common\n\t   * mistake is to accidentally invoke the function yourself instead of letting\n\t   * the `throw` assertion invoke the function for you. For example, when\n\t   * testing if a function named `fn` throws, provide `fn` instead of `fn()` as\n\t   * the target for the assertion.\n\t   *\n\t   *     expect(fn).to.throw();     // Good! Tests `fn` as desired\n\t   *     expect(fn()).to.throw();   // Bad! Tests result of `fn()`, not `fn`\n\t   *\n\t   * If you need to assert that your function `fn` throws when passed certain\n\t   * arguments, then wrap a call to `fn` inside of another function.\n\t   *\n\t   *     expect(function () { fn(42); }).to.throw();  // Function expression\n\t   *     expect(() => fn(42)).to.throw();             // ES6 arrow function\n\t   *\n\t   * Another common mistake is to provide an object method (or any stand-alone\n\t   * function that relies on `this`) as the target of the assertion. Doing so is\n\t   * problematic because the `this` context will be lost when the function is\n\t   * invoked by `.throw`; there's no way for it to know what `this` is supposed\n\t   * to be. There are two ways around this problem. One solution is to wrap the\n\t   * method or function call inside of another function. Another solution is to\n\t   * use `bind`.\n\t   *\n\t   *     expect(function () { cat.meow(); }).to.throw();  // Function expression\n\t   *     expect(() => cat.meow()).to.throw();             // ES6 arrow function\n\t   *     expect(cat.meow.bind(cat)).to.throw();           // Bind\n\t   *\n\t   * Finally, it's worth mentioning that it's a best practice in JavaScript to\n\t   * only throw `Error` and derivatives of `Error` such as `ReferenceError`,\n\t   * `TypeError`, and user-defined objects that extend `Error`. No other type of\n\t   * value will generate a stack trace when initialized. With that said, the\n\t   * `throw` assertion does technically support any type of value being thrown,\n\t   * not just `Error` and its derivatives.\n\t   *\n\t   * The aliases `.throws` and `.Throw` can be used interchangeably with\n\t   * `.throw`.\n\t   *\n\t   * @name throw\n\t   * @alias throws\n\t   * @alias Throw\n\t   * @param {Error|ErrorConstructor} errorLike\n\t   * @param {String|RegExp} errMsgMatcher error message\n\t   * @param {String} msg _optional_\n\t   * @see https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error#Error_types\n\t   * @returns error for chaining (null if no error)\n\t   * @namespace BDD\n\t   * @api public\n\t   */\n\t\n\t  function assertThrows (errorLike, errMsgMatcher, msg) {\n\t    if (msg) flag(this, 'message', msg);\n\t    var obj = flag(this, 'object')\n\t      , ssfi = flag(this, 'ssfi')\n\t      , flagMsg = flag(this, 'message')\n\t      , negate = flag(this, 'negate') || false;\n\t    new Assertion(obj, flagMsg, ssfi, true).is.a('function');\n\t\n\t    if (errorLike instanceof RegExp || typeof errorLike === 'string') {\n\t      errMsgMatcher = errorLike;\n\t      errorLike = null;\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    var caughtErr;\n\t    try {\n\t      obj();\n\t    } catch (err) {\n\t      caughtErr = err;\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    // If we have the negate flag enabled and at least one valid argument it means we do expect an error\n\t    // but we want it to match a given set of criteria\n\t    var everyArgIsUndefined = errorLike === undefined && errMsgMatcher === undefined;\n\t\n\t    // If we've got the negate flag enabled and both args, we should only fail if both aren't compatible\n\t    // See Issue #551 and PR #683@GitHub\n\t    var everyArgIsDefined = Boolean(errorLike && errMsgMatcher);\n\t    var errorLikeFail = false;\n\t    var errMsgMatcherFail = false;\n\t\n\t    // Checking if error was thrown\n\t    if (everyArgIsUndefined || !everyArgIsUndefined && !negate) {\n\t      // We need this to display results correctly according to their types\n\t      var errorLikeString = 'an error';\n\t      if (errorLike instanceof Error) {\n\t        errorLikeString = '#{exp}';\n\t      } else if (errorLike) {\n\t        errorLikeString = _.checkError.getConstructorName(errorLike);\n\t      }\n\t\n\t      this.assert(\n\t          caughtErr\n\t        , 'expected #{this} to throw ' + errorLikeString\n\t        , 'expected #{this} to not throw an error but #{act} was thrown'\n\t        , errorLike && errorLike.toString()\n\t        , (caughtErr instanceof Error ?\n\t            caughtErr.toString() : (typeof caughtErr === 'string' ? caughtErr : caughtErr &&\n\t                                    _.checkError.getConstructorName(caughtErr)))\n\t      );\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    if (errorLike && caughtErr) {\n\t      // We should compare instances only if `errorLike` is an instance of `Error`\n\t      if (errorLike instanceof Error) {\n\t        var isCompatibleInstance = _.checkError.compatibleInstance(caughtErr, errorLike);\n\t\n\t        if (isCompatibleInstance === negate) {\n\t          // These checks were created to ensure we won't fail too soon when we've got both args and a negate\n\t          // See Issue #551 and PR #683@GitHub\n\t          if (everyArgIsDefined && negate) {\n\t            errorLikeFail = true;\n\t          } else {\n\t            this.assert(\n\t                negate\n\t              , 'expected #{this} to throw #{exp} but #{act} was thrown'\n\t              , 'expected #{this} to not throw #{exp}' + (caughtErr && !negate ?

The\n\t  primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n\t  registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n\t  why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\t\n\t  Terminology\n\t  -----------\n\t\n\t  - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n\t  - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n\t  - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n\t  - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n\t  - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n\t  - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\t\n\t  A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\t\n\t  Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n\t  state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n\t  rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\t\n\t  Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n\t  promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n\t  settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n\t  itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n\t  itself fulfill.\n\t\n\t\n\t  Basic Usage:\n\t  ------------\n\t\n\t  ```js\n\t  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n\t    // on success\n\t    resolve(value);\n\t\n\t    // on failure\n\t    reject(reason);\n\t  });\n\t\n\t  promise.then(function(value) {\n\t    // on fulfillment\n\t  }, function(reason) {\n\t    // on rejection\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  Advanced Usage:\n\t  ---------------\n\t\n\t  Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n\t  `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\t\n\t  ```js\n\t  function getJSON(url) {\n\t    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n\t      let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\t\n\t      xhr.open('GET', url);\n\t      xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n\t      xhr.responseType = 'json';\n\t      xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n\t      xhr.send();\n\t\n\t      function handler() {\n\t        if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n\t          if (this.status === 200) {\n\t            resolve(this.response);\n\t          } else {\n\t            reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n\t          }\n\t        }\n\t      };\n\t    });\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n\t    // on fulfillment\n\t  }, function(reason) {\n\t    // on rejection\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\t\n\t  ```js\n\t  Promise.all([\n\t    getJSON('/posts'),\n\t    getJSON('/comments')\n\t  ]).then(function(values){\n\t    values[0] // => postsJSON\n\t    values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\t\n\t    return values;\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  @class Promise\n\t  @param {function} resolver\n\t  Useful for tooling.\n\t  @constructor\n\t*/\n\tfunction Promise$2(resolver) {\n\t  this[PROMISE_ID] = nextId();\n\t  this._result = this._state = undefined;\n\t  this._subscribers = [];\n\t\n\t  if (noop !== resolver) {\n\t    typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n\t    this instanceof Promise$2 ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\n\t  }\n\t}\n\t\n\tPromise$2.all = all$1;\n\tPromise$2.race = race$1;\n\tPromise$2.resolve = resolve$1;\n\tPromise$2.reject = reject$1;\n\tPromise$2._setScheduler = setScheduler;\n\tPromise$2._setAsap = setAsap;\n\tPromise$2._asap = asap;\n\t\n\tPromise$2.prototype = {\n\t  constructor: Promise$2,\n\t\n\t  /**\n\t    The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n\t    which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n\t    reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    findUser().then(function(user){\n\t      // user is available\n\t    }, function(reason){\n\t      // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Chaining\n\t    --------\n\t  \n\t    The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n\t    promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n\t    or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t      return user.name;\n\t    }, function (reason) {\n\t      return 'default name';\n\t    }).then(function (userName) {\n\t      // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n\t      // will be `'default name'`\n\t    });\n\t  \n\t    findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t      throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n\t    }, function (reason) {\n\t      throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n\t    }).then(function (value) {\n\t      // never reached\n\t    }, function (reason) {\n\t      // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n\t      // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t    If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t      throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n\t    }).then(function (value) {\n\t      // never reached\n\t    }).then(function (value) {\n\t      // never reached\n\t    }, function (reason) {\n\t      // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Assimilation\n\t    ------------\n\t  \n\t    Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n\t    retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n\t    fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n\t    until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t      return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n\t    }).then(function (comments) {\n\t      // The user's comments are now available\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t      return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n\t    }).then(function (comments) {\n\t      // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n\t    }, function (reason) {\n\t      // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Simple Example\n\t    --------------\n\t  \n\t    Synchronous Example\n\t  \n\t    ```javascript\n\t    let result;\n\t  \n\t    try {\n\t      result = findResult();\n\t      // success\n\t    } catch(reason) {\n\t      // failure\n\t    }\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Errback Example\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    findResult(function(result, err){\n\t      if (err) {\n\t        // failure\n\t      } else {\n\t        // success\n\t      }\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Promise Example;\n\t  \n\t    ```javascript\n\t    findResult().then(function(result){\n\t      // success\n\t    }, function(reason){\n\t      // failure\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Advanced Example\n\t    --------------\n\t  \n\t    Synchronous Example\n\t  \n\t    ```javascript\n\t    let author, books;\n\t  \n\t    try {\n\t      author = findAuthor();\n\t      books  = findBooksByAuthor(author);\n\t      // success\n\t    } catch(reason) {\n\t      // failure\n\t    }\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Errback Example\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t  \n\t    function foundBooks(books) {\n\t  \n\t    }\n\t  \n\t    function failure(reason) {\n\t  \n\t    }\n\t  \n\t    findAuthor(function(author, err){\n\t      if (err) {\n\t        failure(err);\n\t        // failure\n\t      } else {\n\t        try {\n\t          findBoooksByAuthor(author, function(books, err) {\n\t            if (err) {\n\t              failure(err);\n\t            } else {\n\t              try {\n\t                foundBooks(books);\n\t              } catch(reason) {\n\t                failure(reason);\n\t              }\n\t            }\n\t          });\n\t        } catch(error) {\n\t          failure(err);\n\t        }\n\t        // success\n\t      }\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Promise Example;\n\t  \n\t    ```javascript\n\t    findAuthor().\n\t      then(findBooksByAuthor).\n\t      then(function(books){\n\t        // found books\n\t    }).catch(function(reason){\n\t      // something went wrong\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    @method then\n\t    @param {Function} onFulfilled\n\t    @param {Function} onRejected\n\t    Useful for tooling.\n\t    @return {Promise}\n\t  */\n\t  then: then,\n\t\n\t  /**\n\t    `catch` is simply sugar for `then(undefined, onRejection)` which makes it the same\n\t    as the catch block of a try/catch statement.\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    function findAuthor(){\n\t      throw new Error('couldn't find that author');\n\t    }\n\t  \n\t    // synchronous\n\t    try {\n\t      findAuthor();\n\t    } catch(reason) {\n\t      // something went wrong\n\t    }\n\t  \n\t    // async with promises\n\t    findAuthor().catch(function(reason){\n\t      // something went wrong\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    @method catch\n\t    @param {Function} onRejection\n\t    Useful for tooling.\n\t    @return {Promise}\n\t  */\n\t  'catch': function _catch(onRejection) {\n\t    return this.then(null, onRejection);\n\t  }\n\t};\n\t\n\t/*global self*/\n\tfunction polyfill$1() {\n\t    var local = undefined;\n\t\n\t    if (typeof global !== 'undefined') {\n\t        local = global;\n\t    } else if (typeof self !== 'undefined') {\n\t        local = self;\n\t    } else {\n\t        try {\n\t            local = Function('return this')();\n\t        } catch (e) {\n\t            throw new Error('polyfill failed because global object is unavailable in this environment');\n\t        }\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    var P = local.Promise;\n\t\n\t    if (P) {\n\t        var promiseToString = null;\n\t        try {\n\t            promiseToString = Object.prototype.toString.call(P.resolve());\n\t        } catch (e) {\n\t            // silently ignored\n\t        }\n\t\n\t        if (promiseToString === '[object Promise]' && !P.cast) {\n\t            return;\n\t        }\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    local.Promise = Promise$2;\n\t}\n\t\n\t// Strange compat..\n\tPromise$2.polyfill = polyfill$1;\n\tPromise$2.Promise = Promise$2;\n\t\n\treturn Promise$2;\n\n\t})));\n\n\t\n\t/* WEBPACK VAR INJECTION */}.call(exports, __webpack_require__(54), (function() { return this; }())))\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 54 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports) {\n\n\t// shim for using process in browser\n\tvar process = module.exports = {};\n\t\n\t// cached from whatever global is present so that test runners that stub it\n\t// don't break things.

One common\n   * mistake is to accidentally invoke the function yourself instead of letting\n   * the `throw` assertion invoke the function for you. For example, when\n   * testing if a function named `fn` throws, provide `fn` instead of `fn()` as\n   * the target for the assertion.\n   *\n   *     expect(fn).to.throw();     // Good! Tests `fn` as desired\n   *     expect(fn()).to.throw();   // Bad! Tests result of `fn()`, not `fn`\n   *\n   * If you need to assert that your function `fn` throws when passed certain\n   * arguments, then wrap a call to `fn` inside of another function.\n   *\n   *     expect(function () { fn(42); }).to.throw();  // Function expression\n   *     expect(() => fn(42)).to.throw();             // ES6 arrow function\n   *\n   * Another common mistake is to provide an object method (or any stand-alone\n   * function that relies on `this`) as the target of the assertion. Doing so is\n   * problematic because the `this` context will be lost when the function is\n   * invoked by `.throw`; there's no way for it to know what `this` is supposed\n   * to be. There are two ways around this problem. One solution is to wrap the\n   * method or function call inside of another function. Another solution is to\n   * use `bind`.\n   *\n   *     expect(function () { cat.meow(); }).to.throw();  // Function expression\n   *     expect(() => cat.meow()).to.throw();             // ES6 arrow function\n   *     expect(cat.meow.bind(cat)).to.throw();           // Bind\n   *\n   * Finally, it's worth mentioning that it's a best practice in JavaScript to\n   * only throw `Error` and derivatives of `Error` such as `ReferenceError`,\n   * `TypeError`, and user-defined objects that extend `Error`. No other type of\n   * value will generate a stack trace when initialized. With that said, the\n   * `throw` assertion does technically support any type of value being thrown,\n   * not just `Error` and its derivatives.\n   *\n   * The aliases `.throws` and `.Throw` can be used interchangeably with\n   * `.throw`.\n   *\n   * @name throw\n   * @alias throws\n   * @alias Throw\n   * @param {Error|ErrorConstructor} errorLike\n   * @param {String|RegExp} errMsgMatcher error message\n   * @param {String} msg _optional_\n   * @see https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error#Error_types\n   * @returns error for chaining (null if no error)\n   * @namespace BDD\n   * @api public\n   */\n\n  function assertThrows (errorLike, errMsgMatcher, msg) {\n    if (msg) flag(this, 'message', msg);\n    var obj = flag(this, 'object')\n      , ssfi = flag(this, 'ssfi')\n      , flagMsg = flag(this, 'message')\n      , negate = flag(this, 'negate') || false;\n    new Assertion(obj, flagMsg, ssfi, true).is.a('function');\n\n    if (errorLike instanceof RegExp || typeof errorLike === 'string') {\n      errMsgMatcher = errorLike;\n      errorLike = null;\n    }\n\n    var caughtErr;\n    try {\n      obj();\n    } catch (err) {\n      caughtErr = err;\n    }\n\n    // If we have the negate flag enabled and at least one valid argument it means we do expect an error\n    // but we want it to match a given set of criteria\n    var everyArgIsUndefined = errorLike === undefined && errMsgMatcher === undefined;\n\n    // If we've got the negate flag enabled and both args, we should only fail if both aren't compatible\n    // See Issue #551 and PR #683@GitHub\n    var everyArgIsDefined = Boolean(errorLike && errMsgMatcher);\n    var errorLikeFail = false;\n    var errMsgMatcherFail = false;\n\n    // Checking if error was thrown\n    if (everyArgIsUndefined || !everyArgIsUndefined && !negate) {\n      // We need this to display results correctly according to their types\n      var errorLikeString = 'an error';\n      if (errorLike instanceof Error) {\n        errorLikeString = '#{exp}';\n      } else if (errorLike) {\n        errorLikeString = _.checkError.getConstructorName(errorLike);\n      }\n\n      this.assert(\n          caughtErr\n        , 'expected #{this} to throw ' + errorLikeString\n        , 'expected #{this} to not throw an error but #{act} was thrown'\n        , errorLike && errorLike.toString()\n        , (caughtErr instanceof Error ?\n            caughtErr.toString() : (typeof caughtErr === 'string' ? caughtErr : caughtErr &&\n                                    _.checkError.getConstructorName(caughtErr)))\n      );\n    }\n\n    if (errorLike && caughtErr) {\n      // We should compare instances only if `errorLike` is an instance of `Error`\n      if (errorLike instanceof Error) {\n        var isCompatibleInstance = _.checkError.compatibleInstance(caughtErr, errorLike);\n\n        if (isCompatibleInstance === negate) {\n          // These checks were created to ensure we won't fail too soon when we've got both args and a negate\n          // See Issue #551 and PR #683@GitHub\n          if (everyArgIsDefined && negate) {\n            errorLikeFail = true;\n          } else {\n            this.assert(\n                negate\n              , 'expected #{this} to throw #{exp} but #{act} was thrown'\n              , 'expected #{this} to not throw #{exp}' + (caughtErr && !negate ?

For example, even if other promises given to the\n  `promises` array argument are resolved, but the first settled promise has\n  become rejected before the other promises became fulfilled, the returned\n  promise will become rejected:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let promise1 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n    setTimeout(function(){\n      resolve('promise 1');\n    }, 200);\n  });\n\n  let promise2 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n    setTimeout(function(){\n      reject(new Error('promise 2'));\n    }, 100);\n  });\n\n  Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then(function(result){\n    // Code here never runs\n  }, function(reason){\n    // reason.message === 'promise 2' because promise 2 became rejected before\n    // promise 1 became fulfilled\n  });\n  ```\n\n  An example real-world use case is implementing timeouts:\n\n  ```javascript\n  Promise.race([ajax('foo.json'), timeout(5000)])\n  ```\n\n  @method race\n  @static\n  @param {Array} promises array of promises to observe\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @return {Promise} a promise which settles in the same way as the first passed\n  promise to settle.\n*/\nfunction race(entries) {\n  /*jshint validthis:true */\n  var Constructor = this;\n\n  if (!isArray(entries)) {\n    return new Constructor(function (_, reject) {\n      return reject(new TypeError('You must pass an array to race.'));\n    });\n  } else {\n    return new Constructor(function (resolve, reject) {\n      var length = entries.length;\n      for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {\n        Constructor.resolve(entries[i]).then(resolve, reject);\n      }\n    });\n  }\n}\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// lib/es6-promise/promise/race.js","'use strict';\n\nexport default reject;\nimport { noop, reject as _reject } from '../-internal';\n\n/**\n  `Promise.reject` returns a promise rejected with the passed `reason`.\n  It is shorthand for the following:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n    reject(new Error('WHOOPS'));\n  });\n\n  promise.then(function(value){\n    // Code here doesn't run because the promise is rejected!\n  }, function(reason){\n    // reason.message === 'WHOOPS'\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Instead of writing the above, your code now simply becomes the following:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let promise = Promise.reject(new Error('WHOOPS'));\n\n  promise.then(function(value){\n    // Code here doesn't run because the promise is rejected!\n  }, function(reason){\n    // reason.message === 'WHOOPS'\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @method reject\n  @static\n  @param {Any} reason value that the returned promise will be rejected with.\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @return {Promise} a promise rejected with the given `reason`.\n*/\nfunction reject(reason) {\n  /*jshint validthis:true */\n  var Constructor = this;\n  var promise = new Constructor(noop);\n  _reject(promise, reason);\n  return promise;\n}\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// lib/es6-promise/promise/reject.js","'use strict';\n\nexport default Promise;\n\nimport { isFunction } from './utils';\n\nimport { noop, nextId, PROMISE_ID, initializePromise } from './-internal';\n\nimport { asap, setAsap, setScheduler } from './asap';\n\nimport all from './promise/all';\nimport race from './promise/race';\nimport Resolve from './promise/resolve';\nimport Reject from './promise/reject';\nimport then from './then';\n\nfunction needsResolver() {\n  throw new TypeError('You must pass a resolver function as the first argument to the promise constructor');\n}\n\nfunction needsNew() {\n  throw new TypeError(\"Failed to construct 'Promise': Please use the 'new' operator, this object constructor cannot be called as a function.\");\n}\n\n/**\n  Promise objects represent the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. The\n  primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n  registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n  why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n  Terminology\n  -----------\n\n  - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n  - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n  - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n  - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n  - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n  - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\n  A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\n  Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n  state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n  rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\n  Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n  promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n  settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n  itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n  itself fulfill.\n\n\n  Basic Usage:\n  ------------\n\n  ```js\n  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    // on success\n    resolve(value);\n\n    // on failure\n    reject(reason);\n  });\n\n  promise.then(function(value) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Advanced Usage:\n  ---------------\n\n  Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n  `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\n  ```js\n  function getJSON(url) {\n    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n      let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n      xhr.open('GET', url);\n      xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n      xhr.responseType = 'json';\n      xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n      xhr.send();\n\n      function handler() {\n        if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n          if (this.status === 200) {\n            resolve(this.response);\n          } else {\n            reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n          }\n        }\n      };\n    });\n  }\n\n  getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\n  ```js\n  Promise.all([\n    getJSON('/posts'),\n    getJSON('/comments')\n  ]).then(function(values){\n    values[0] // => postsJSON\n    values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\n    return values;\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @class Promise\n  @param {function} resolver\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @constructor\n*/\nfunction Promise(resolver) {\n  this[PROMISE_ID] = nextId();\n  this._result = this._state = undefined;\n  this._subscribers = [];\n\n  if (noop !== resolver) {\n    typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n    this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\n  }\n}\n\nPromise.all = all;\nPromise.race = race;\nPromise.resolve = Resolve;\nPromise.reject = Reject;\nPromise._setScheduler = setScheduler;\nPromise._setAsap = setAsap;\nPromise._asap = asap;\n\nPromise.prototype = {\n  constructor: Promise,\n\n  /**\n    The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n    which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n    reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n  \n    ```js\n    findUser().then(function(user){\n      // user is available\n    }, function(reason){\n      // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Chaining\n    --------\n  \n    The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n    promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n    or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n  \n    ```js\n    findUser().then(function (user) {\n      return user.name;\n    }, function (reason) {\n      return 'default name';\n    }).then(function (userName) {\n      // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n      // will be `'default name'`\n    });\n  \n    findUser().then(function (user) {\n      throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n    }, function (reason) {\n      throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n    }).then(function (value) {\n      // never reached\n    }, function (reason) {\n      // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n      // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n    });\n    ```\n    If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n  \n    ```js\n    findUser().then(function (user) {\n      throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n    }).then(function (value) {\n      // never reached\n    }).then(function (value) {\n      // never reached\n    }, function (reason) {\n      // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Assimilation\n    ------------\n  \n    Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n    retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n    fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n    until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n  \n    ```js\n    findUser().then(function (user) {\n      return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n    }).then(function (comments) {\n      // The user's comments are now available\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n  \n    ```js\n    findUser().then(function (user) {\n      return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n    }).then(function (comments) {\n      // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n    }, function (reason) {\n      // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Simple Example\n    --------------\n  \n    Synchronous Example\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let result;\n  \n    try {\n      result = findResult();\n      // success\n    } catch(reason) {\n      // failure\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    Errback Example\n  \n    ```js\n    findResult(function(result, err){\n      if (err) {\n        // failure\n      } else {\n        // success\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Promise Example;\n  \n    ```javascript\n    findResult().then(function(result){\n      // success\n    }, function(reason){\n      // failure\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Advanced Example\n    --------------\n  \n    Synchronous Example\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let author, books;\n  \n    try {\n      author = findAuthor();\n      books  = findBooksByAuthor(author);\n      // success\n    } catch(reason) {\n      // failure\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    Errback Example\n  \n    ```js\n  \n    function foundBooks(books) {\n  \n    }\n  \n    function failure(reason) {\n  \n    }\n  \n    findAuthor(function(author, err){\n      if (err) {\n        failure(err);\n        // failure\n      } else {\n        try {\n          findBoooksByAuthor(author, function(books, err) {\n            if (err) {\n              failure(err);\n            } else {\n              try {\n                foundBooks(books);\n              } catch(reason) {\n                failure(reason);\n              }\n            }\n          });\n        } catch(error) {\n          failure(err);\n        }\n        // success\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Promise Example;\n  \n    ```javascript\n    findAuthor().\n      then(findBooksByAuthor).\n      then(function(books){\n        // found books\n    }).catch(function(reason){\n      // something went wrong\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    @method then\n    @param {Function} onFulfilled\n    @param {Function} onRejected\n    Useful for tooling.\n    @return {Promise}\n  */\n  then: then,\n\n  /**\n    `catch` is simply sugar for `then(undefined, onRejection)` which makes it the same\n    as the catch block of a try/catch statement.\n  \n    ```js\n    function findAuthor(){\n      throw new Error('couldn't find that author');\n    }\n  \n    // synchronous\n    try {\n      findAuthor();\n    } catch(reason) {\n      // something went wrong\n    }\n  \n    // async with promises\n    findAuthor().catch(function(reason){\n      // something went wrong\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    @method catch\n    @param {Function} onRejection\n    Useful for tooling.\n    @return {Promise}\n  */\n  'catch': function _catch(onRejection) {\n    return this.then(null, onRejection);\n  }\n};\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// lib/es6-promise/promise.js","/*global self*/\n'use strict';\n\nexport default polyfill;\nimport Promise from './promise';\nfunction polyfill() {\n    var local = undefined;\n\n    if (typeof global !== 'undefined') {\n        local = global;\n    } else if (typeof self !== 'undefined') {\n        local = self;\n    } else {\n        try {\n            local = Function('return this')();\n        } catch (e) {\n            throw new Error('polyfill failed because global object is unavailable in this environment');\n        }\n    }\n\n    var P = local.Promise;\n\n    if (P) {\n        var promiseToString = null;\n        try {\n            promiseToString = Object.prototype.toString.call(P.resolve());\n        } catch (e) {\n            // silently ignored\n        }\n\n        if (promiseToString === '[object Promise]' && !P.cast) {\n            return;\n        }\n    }\n\n    local.Promise = Promise;\n}\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// lib/es6-promise/polyfill.js","'use strict';\n\nimport Promise from './es6-promise/promise';\nimport polyfill from './es6-promise/polyfill';\n\n// Strange compat..\nPromise.polyfill = polyfill;\nPromise.Promise = Promise;\nexport default Promise;\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// lib/es6-promise.js","// shim for using process in browser\nvar process = module.exports = {};\n\n// cached from whatever global is present so that test runners that stub it\n// don't break things.
